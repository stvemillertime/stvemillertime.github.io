As a college student I read tons of blogs from industry insiders who shared ideas on the world of CNO, intrusion analysis, malware, threat detection and incident response. I found the raw, unfiltered takes much more illuminating than books or schoolwork and the blogs were always great starting points for advancing my own learnings and building understanding and world views that would come to help me in my career. 

This is a curated collection of my favorite resources, links along with some personal ideas, thoughts, rants and writings on YARA, DFIR, malware detection, threat intelligence, adversary tradecraft and so forth. Maybe some folks stumble along and find this, and maybe it helps you helps y'all who are wishing to learn and grow and get into the security space.
