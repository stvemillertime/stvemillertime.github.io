title: On making analysis durable
categories: [analysis, synapse, suricata, yara]

I am the type of analyst that focuses on small, unique, things that I like to utterly destroy in depth and detail. I am a scalpel, a tweezer, a rifle, a laser guided missile. While I oft solve for precision, in all my work the thing I love the most is making my analysis durable.

For me making analysis "durable" means choosing to put it in structured forms & tech that are consistent, recallable, programmatically query-able & applicable to fresh data. That's why I love using Synapse, Suricata, Sigma and YARA. I want my analysis to live as long as possible.

“Many grains of frankincense on the same altar: one falls before, another falls after; but it makes no difference.”

Perhaps it is all in vain, but I take some small satisfaction in trying to make my analysis durable and in forms that will easily serve others.
